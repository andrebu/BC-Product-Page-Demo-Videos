BigCommerce Product Page Demo Videos Plugin
===========================================

BigCommerce Product Page Demo Videos with a Play/Stop button in the thumbnail image selector section below product image.
by Andre Bulatov - iamandrebulatov - http://andrebulatov.com

***Important Note
-----------------
In Snippets/ProductTinyImage.html, the code for the TinyThumbImage list below the product image on Product pages, must be altered so that a click on an image registers as "%%GLOBAL_TinyImageOverJavascript%%" instead of the BigCommerce default of 'onclick="%%GLOBAL_TinyImageClickJavascript%%"' which opens a lightbox onClick instead.
```HTML
<!-- Original BigCommerce thumbnail functionality -->
<li style = "height:%%GLOBAL_ProductTinyBoxHeight%%px; width:%%GLOBAL_ProductTinyBoxWidth%%px;" onmouseover="%%GLOBAL_TinyImageOverJavascript%%" onclick="%%GLOBAL_TinyImageClickJavascript%%" id="TinyImageBox_%%GLOBAL_ProductThumbIndex%%">
```

To turn off the lightbox onClick logic and to make the thumbnails change on click instead of hover, change the code to be as follows:
```HTML
<!-- Updated so that a "click" changes the image and thumbnail -->
<li style = "height:%%GLOBAL_ProductTinyBoxHeight%%px; width:%%GLOBAL_ProductTinyBoxWidth%%px;" onclick="%%GLOBAL_TinyImageOverJavascript%%" id="TinyImageBox_%%GLOBAL_ProductThumbIndex%%">
```  


## Installation instructions

> These are the latest instructions and are up to date.  I will update them as the widget is improved.

1. Add **ProductPageVideos.html Panel file** to your folder in WebDAV/dav/template/Panels  
  1. To access your WebDAV panel, BigCommerce gives you instructions in your Admin Panel.  
  2. Click "Design" in the top right corner of your store admin panel.  
  3. Then click "WebDAV" in the "Current Theme" section and follow the instructions
2. Add %%Panel.ProductPageVideos%% to bottom of Panels/product.html
  + Example:
```HTML
        </div>

        %%Panel.ProductPageBrandDescription%%        
<!-- Put panel as it is here, right before the closing body tag -->
        %%Panel.ProductPageVideos%%        
<!-- Put panel as it is here, right before the closing body tag -->
        
    </body>
</html>
```

3. Create Videos Upload Folder
  + Create a folder for uploading the product demo videos in WebDAV /dav/Contents/Videos/
  + When you upload videos, add an .mp4 version, as well as an .ogv version for playback on all browsers
  + Name the videos by the product ID.  The product ID can be found by ... ?  

4. Add <!-- Product Page Videos --> CSS to stye.css (this step will soon be made unnecessary)

6.  A solution proposed for iOS to fix so that playing video does not enter full screen mode but rather plays inline (in the end, this proposed code does not work reliably, or at all) - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19521667/disable-fullscreen-iphone-video
7.  Similar to #6 above but for Android.  Suggests using custom JS for autoplay function and also some <video> tag markup standards that should allow video to play on ANdroid along iwth other browsers like Firefox and Safari. - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711078/html5-video-element-on-android
8.  Similar to #6 and #7 above as in this thread, the ttempt was to make videos play inline rather than be forced into fullscreen mode.  The main suggestion is to use "webkit-playinline," but as elegant as this soltion is, it does not work. - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711078/html5-video-element-on-android
